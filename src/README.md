# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

Data is persisted in a local SQLite database (`activities.db`) so activity and signup changes remain after server restarts.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. (Optional) Remove the local database to start fresh with seed data:

   ```
   rm -f activities.db
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Data is stored in SQLite tables:

- `activities` for activity metadata
- `signups` for student registrations

On first startup, seed activities and initial participants are inserted automatically.
